# Analysis on Determinants of Body Weight

## Overview

This analysis uses data from the U.S. Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR II) to explore the relationships between body weight and key anthropometric and demographic variables, providing insights that can inform personalized health interventions and operational strategies.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/00-simulated_data` contains simulated data.
-   `data/01-raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from https://www.openlab.psu.edu/.
-   `data/02-analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, visualize, and analyse the data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
